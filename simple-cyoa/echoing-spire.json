Now, you stand before your prize: The Echoing Spire. Legends claim it is a place outside of time, a living monument of a long-dead civilization, and that its heart holds a power that can reshape the world. It is only under the light of tonight's twin moons that the entrance reveals itself. Before you, the path splits. A grand, crumbling staircase leads directly to the main gate, which glows with a faint, inviting light. To its left, a narrow, winding track disappears into the shadows at the tower's base, marked by a single, moss-covered stone.",

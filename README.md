# README

This is the __Interpolnet Project__. This project is about creating many different self-contained webpages all within the project that is hosted as a single website.

Each webpage should follow these guidelines:
- Use a distinct, unique, and consistent color scheme and typography.
- Use many passive and active animations to indicate what elements are interactable, and when things change in response to either automatic updates or user input.
- Ensure that the webpage is designed to be mobile-friendly.
- Use a responsive design.
- Demonstrate a single, consistent idea as the focus webpage.
- Include many links to other pages in this project's website.

Each webpage MUST follow these critical rules:
- Each webpage must have an entry in `Directory.md`.
- Each webpage's `index.html` and all of its assets (images, CSS files, JS files, HTML files, etc) must be placed into a single subdirectory of this repository's root director.y
- Each webpage must have an `index.html` in its subdirectory.
